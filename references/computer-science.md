## Trees

This resource is really not at all necessary to understand or work with the DOM, _but_ if you want to know more about the concept of tree structures (like the DOM!) in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.
