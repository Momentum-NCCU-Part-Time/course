## 🎯 Objectives

- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Lists and list comprehensions

## 🏗️ Project

Begin the project [Word Frequency]({{ site.data.phase2.projects.word_frequency.url }}). A **dictionary** will help you solve the problem of counting words. This will be due on {{ site.data.phase1.projects.html_dog_adoption.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}.

At _minimum_ you should be able to count words and print that count, even if the formatting of your output is not 100% on point.
