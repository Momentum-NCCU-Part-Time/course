# How to Prepare for Final Presentations

{% include summary_toc.html %}

The final presentation is your public debut as a professional technologist. The focus should be squarely on you and all your skills. We want you to demonstrate all the reasons an employer would want to hire you. 

Show your confidence, enthusiasm, ability to learn a lot in a short time, and readiness to contribute as part of a professional development team.

You'll record a video together as a team that we’ll play during the live event. Your presentation should be 4-6 minutes in length. 

You need to prepare four things:

1. Personal Introduction
2. Video demo of your project
3. Project summary page
4. Q&A with panelists

[**Please use this form to submit the video, a short project description, and a link to your project summary page**](https://forms.gle/hRRfGH2kWSEoFXrE7).

## PERSONAL INTRODUCTION

Each developer on the team will introduce themselves live during the presentation. Plan to talk for about a minute. You should tell us about what you did before Momentum, any hobbies or other skills you have, and something about why you're interested in a career in technology. Imagine you're talking to your future co-workers who want to get to know you.

You'll get public speaking coaching on Thursday morning to help you prepare for this part of the presentation.

## VIDEO DEMO

Record a 5-minute video that demos your app's features. It doesn't have to be _precisely_ 5 minutes but it should not be more than a minute off in either direction.

**Your video should be scripted.** Each team member should narrate some part of the video as you demo your app.

If you have video editing abilities and want to edit your video, you’re welcome to do that, but it is not expected. One way to do this is to get the whole team together on Zoom, screen share, and record.

The video should be polished and professional. This is something that you will share with employers, so it should represent you well. Think of it in the same way you’d think about a resume or cover letter.

### Video Presentation Structure

#### 1. High-level app description

Describe your app and what it does, concisely, in one or two sentences. _Example_: "8-Track is an app that lets you build a to-do list for listening to your music."

#### 2. Explain why you built it

What is the central problem you are solving or the need that your app addresses? Tell us about why your team was motivated to build this or what you wanted to accomplish in this project. Was there anything about your prior experience that shaped how you approached this project?

#### 3. Discuss features and your experience

You don't have to mention _all_ of the following, but consider touching on several of these points. Think about what you want to show off. **You should mention the technologies you used by name**.

Remember, the focus should be on _your skills_ and _what you did_.

- What part or parts of your app did you work on?
- What _specifically_ did you do and how did you do it?
    - How is your app structured?
    - What specific technologies did you use?
- What did you learn doing this project?
    - Did you teach yourself something new? Explain what you learned and why you learned it.
    - Did you do something a different way than you have before? Why?
- Was there a particular challenge you had to solve or tricky bug you had to fix?
    - Describe what it was and what was tricky or interesting about it.
    - What did you do to you solve it?
- What technical decisions did you have to make?
    - What were your considerations and tradeoffs, and why did you make the decisions you did?
- Are there any features your app has that were technically challenging to implement?

#### 4. Conclusion

This can be one or two sentences. Some ways you could consider wrapping up your presentation include:

- Recap what the app does and why it's awesome
- What you plan next for the app
- What you're excited about doing professionally in your developer job
- Notable lessons learned
- Thanks for audience's time

## PROJECT SUMMARY PAGE

This is a simple one-page site that includes a project description, information about your team, and links to the production version of your project, GitHub repos, and presentation video. You can [use this template repo](https://github.com/momentumlearn/project-page-template) to create your own project page repo in your team's GitHub organization, then clone it and customize it following the instructions in the README.

The project summary page should be done by Friday morning. Submit your link to the production version via [this form](https://forms.gle/Sjwkz9nDsexgVjyH6).

## Q&A WITH PANELISTS

Following the presentation, each team will have a few minutes of moderated Q&A time with panelists.

_Each person on your team should be prepared to answer questions_. Decide ahead of time who will take what type of questions.

### Q&A Prep

You should be prepared to answer questions about the technical implementation of your application, about how you envision it being used and the user needs it addresses, and about ways you might develop it in the future.

Examples questions being given to the panelists include:

- Can you tell me about why you decided to use [_some technology_] to build this feature?
- What was one challenge or unexpected thing you encountered during your project, and how did you deal with it?
- What is your favorite thing about this application?
- Did you have to make any hard choices or compromises during development? How did you make that decision?
- What was something new you learned to do or got really good at doing during this project?
- If you were to keep working on this, what is the next feature you would add?
- What did your team do really well together?

### How to Handle Q&A Live

Each person on your team will have an opportunity to speak during Q&A, so each person should prepare to make use of that opportunity.

You can agree on your team who will take each of the above questions, or categories of questions, if they are asked.

Another way to do this is to take turns with whatever is asked. Plan who will take the first audience question, then the second, then the third.

If it’s your turn and the question is _obviously_ one that is better answered by someone else on the team (because they worked on that feature, for example), you can give a short or partial answer, and then gracefully hand it over to your teammate.

If you are a member of a group that is well represented in the tech industry, you can help to amplify voices that are not usually heard. Please consider handing over speaking time to a teammate if they have not had as much time to speak about technical topics.

#### How to handle a question you don't know the answer to

This is the same advice we have for technical interviews.

**Pivot to a topic you are prepared to talk about!**

Try to make the transition as relevant as you can. You can say "I don't know" if you feel comfortable doing that, but DON'T STOP THERE! Take the opportunity to talk about something you do know.

Do not feel compelled to confess that you don't know something and DO NOT APOLOGIZE.

**All you have to do is express interest in the question, which shows you are a curious and undaunted continual learner, and keep the conversation going!**

Example: _"Oh, that's an interesting question. The way we thought about [that broad issue] in our app is...[insert something you are prepared to talk about]."_

## ON THE DAY OF THE PRESENTATION

- Wear something neat and presentable. Business casual dress is a good choice.
- Check your lighting. We should be able to see your face on the screen.
- Create a background screen that all members of the team can enable on Zoom. The background should have your team name and/or logo clearly visible. It does not have to be fancy; the point is to make team members easily identifiable on screen.
- You should be on mute except during personal intros and Q&A.
