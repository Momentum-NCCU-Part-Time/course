- Using the command line
- Git & GitHub

## üèóÔ∏è Today's Project: Git It

Complete [Git-It]({{site.data.phase1.projects.git_it.url}}), a tutorial program that will walk you through the basics of Git and GitHub. This project is due {{site.data.phase1.projects.git_it.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}.

To install it, use the command line to run:
`brew install git-it`

This should put the Git-it program in your Applications folder. You can start it by pressing `command-spacebar` on your Mac and typing "git-it" and hitting return when you see the icon.

Git-it will tell you to install Github Desktop. You do not have to install this, although you can if you want. We won't be using it in this program.

The first time you run Git-it, you may get a notice that the application is from an unknown developer. If you do, right-click on the application and then choose "Open." In the dialog that pops up, choose to run the application.

Once the application is running, read the instructions and complete the tasks in Git-it. It will take you some time to get all the way through it.

To complete the project, you must submit the link to the pull request that you will create in the second-to-last Git-It task.

Your link should look similar to this, with a different number at the end: `https://github.com/jlord/patchwork/pull/37062`

[Submit the link to your pull request url using this form](https://forms.gle/hKL37abHZ7TEoyWT6) before tomorrow's meeting.
