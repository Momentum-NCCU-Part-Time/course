## Hours

Everyone at Momentum, staff and learners included, is expected to be online and available to each other between the core hours of 9:30-5:30 each weekday.

## Taking Breaks

Breaks are important.

Be good to yourself and take time to make a cup of tea, move your body, eat a snack, take your dog for a walk, listen to the birds sing...whatever. **You'll be much more productive if you take frequent breaks.**

We expect you to take a one-hour break away from the computer for lunch. Set your Slack status to let people know you‚Äôre not available.

If you'll be away from your computer outside of lunch and short breaks, please let folks know in Slack. We understand that everyone has responsibilities and appointments, so please take the time you need. Just inform staff and colleagues on your team so that folks know what to expect.

## Using Slack

You are likely be using asynchronous communication tools like Slack in your tech career, so knowing how to use them is an essential part of your training.

- **[Update your status](https://slack.com/help/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability)** to let people know if you are online and available or if you are away from your computer for lunch or personal matters.
- You don't need to respond instantly to Slack messages, but try to get back to people **within a reasonable amount of time during the same day**. An hour or two can be fine if you are very busy, but please check regularly to make sure people are not waiting on you for a response.
- Please **use the public team channel** for any questions that would be of general interest or benefit. This includes questions about events, deadlines, or technical questions about code.
- When asking instructors for code help, _please post your question in a public channel_. Openly asking questions will benefit everyone on your team, so we strongly prefer discussing them publicly. Use direct messages when you need to discuss personal information.
- If you would like a specific person's input, for example a teammate who has worked on the same issue, or an instructor,  you can **@ a person using their Slack handle**, like so: "`@Kelly (Learner)`, can you show me how you got the date to be formatted correctly on the page?"
- People choose when they engage with Slack, so **nobody is ever bothering anyone by asking a question in Slack**. You will often be helping multiple teammates who share your question.

### How to ask a technical question in Slack

Asking precise questions about code is another skill that requires practice before it becomes familiar. It can be hard to find the right words, or even know what to ask. It‚Äôs ok not to get the phrasing right, and **it‚Äôs ok to ask about anything you are having trouble with**, including "how do I start?". 

When asking the question, remember that Slack is an asyncronous communication tool, so people may be responding when you are away and can't immediately provide additional information.

Keep that in mind when you are framing your question, and provide as much context as possible up front. Don't let the fear of a question not being "perfect" prevent you from asking it. Expect that you will get requests for clarification, and be ready to provide essential context and information to folks who are trying to help you.

- Describe the problem you are seeing as precisely as you can. Ask clearly for what you need, whether it‚Äôs a clarification, a suggestion, a resource, help spotting an error...whatever.
- Take a screenshot of what you are seeing if it would help someone help you.

    - To share it, add it to a Slack message by clicking the plus button below the input box, or dragging the file from your desktop into the Slack window.
- If you asking about some lines of code, copy and paste it in your message or include a GitHub link.
    - [Format code in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages) using three backticks like this: ``` or the  The backtick key is at the top left of your keyboard.)

**Everyone is welcome to answer technical questions asked in Slack**. If you are asking a question and want the attention of a specific person or specific people, you can use the ‚Äò@‚Äô symbol and their Slack username to notify them.

## Expectations for Video Meetings

- Please have video when you are on a Zoom meeting at Momentum. If you need a video break for whatever reason, just let the instructor or staff know that you'll have your camera off.
- Whether or not they can see you on video, your instructor assumes you are there and fully engaged during meetings. We often call on people by name during team meetings.
- You are welcome to move around as you need to during meetings and position yourself as you are most comfortable.
- **Please keep your mic muted unless you are currently talking**. That lets everyone hear the current speaker more clearly. On Zoom, you can use the spacebar to quickly and temporarily mute or unmute yourself.
- If you have connection problems or can't join via computer for whatever reason, you can use the phone number to call in to the meeting and join via audio.
- **If you would like to ask a question, you can use the raise hand feature** or use the team channel on Slack to type questions during meetings.
- Use [the feedback options in Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Nonverbal-Feedback-During-Meetings#h_50523139-7bac-403b-9c59-1755ada65ad9), found under the Participants tab.
- Minimize distractions in your environment as much as possible. Consider [turning on your  "Do Not Disturb" setting on your computer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-do-not-disturb-mchl999b7c1a/mac) during meetings and logging out of social media or anything else likely to distract you.

### Zoom Setting Suggestions

_These settings are recommended specifically to minimize the strain of being on Zoom for long periods of time. Please do what is best for you._

- Set your Zoom window to use Gallery View instead of Speaker View.
- Don't use full screen view unless someone is screen sharing and you need to read the code.
- Consider making your window smaller to minimize the size of the faces staring at you.
- Choose to hide self-view so that you don't see yourself reflected back to you. (While you are on a meeting, you can do this by by clicking on the three dots in the blue square in the upper right corner of your own Zoom box, and selecting "Hide self view" from the menu.)

## Working outside of meeting times

- Join the [Momentum Co-Working Room]({{ site.zoom_link_coworking }}) to work alongside other learners remotely. This is our virtual common space for connecting with your teammates outside of scheduled meeting times. It‚Äôs ok to use this space to socialize and chat with each other!
-  **Use Slack** to ask questions or share things you‚Äôve discovered while you are working.
    - **Please use public channels for any code-related questions**. Your team's channel or `#code-help` are good options.
    - Explore other channels: `#general` is for the entire Momentum community, including alums. `#happy-place` is for pet pictures and sharing whatever makes you happy üòÅ.
- Use collaboration tools to help each other or get help from an instructor. Use **the VS Code LiveShare extension** to be able to work collaboratively in your editor.

## Working in groups

- Schedule regular video meetings using a tool everyone feels comfortable with. Learners have had success using Google Meets, Zoom, and Discord.
- You can pair to write code using VS Code LiveShare.
- Important team decisions that happen verbally in a conversation should be documented in writing in a shared public place, like on a Trello board or pinned to a Slack channel.
- Slack conversations should take place in shared channels as much as possible. Private DMs should be reserved for personal interactions.
- If you are meeting on a video or audio call, establish and agree to a procedure for speaking in turn and making sure that everyone has an opportunity to be heard.
- It may be helpful to have a group leader whose role is to moderate the conversation. The leader can ask people by name if they would like to speak, so that everyone is invited to contribute.
- Consensus is important when decisions must be made. Find out if all members of the group are in agreement by asking people by name if they agree.
