Momentum is above all a community of continuous learners. Each one of us helps to build this community and our learning environment each day. We‚Äôve given careful thought to the things we value in each other and in our community as a whole.

## Our Learning Environment and Values

Together we create an environment that is supportive of the hard work of learning to code.

We collaborate with each other, and we give each other space for focused time when we need it.

At Momentum, it is safe to ask questions, to make mistakes, and to try new things without a guarantee that everything will go perfectly well.

We are curious and open-minded, receptive to each other‚Äôs thoughts and ideas, and generous with our help.

Patience, kindness, and compassion towards ourselves and others will make meeting our shared and individual goals more possible.

We celebrate each other‚Äôs successes and empathize with each other‚Äôs struggles.

## Expectations

We will take responsibility for guiding and mentoring you; you will take responsibility for getting the most out of this program.

### Ask questions without reservation.

If you are confused or need more information, ask a question. It's ok to ask questions even when you don't know what to ask. We expect that you will need help. And chances are good that if you have a question, someone else has the same one and will be grateful to you for asking.

### Do all the work we ask you to do.

We don‚Äôt expect you‚Äôll be able to do everything in every project. The projects are hard, and a lot of programming is learning from our mistakes. But every project must be submitted.

### Do your best to figure things out.

We don't expect you to know how to do anything, but we do expect you to use all your resources to figure things out. That includes looking things up (use this site!), asking other folks, and trying things just to see what happens. Don't be afraid of breaking things.

### Keep trying even when it gets really hard.

You'll have to get used to doing things that you barely understand, working through frustration, and asking for the help that you need. Don't give up; you CAN do this!

### Treat everyone with respect.

You‚Äôre going to meet people who are not like you here. You‚Äôre going to wonder why someone‚Äôs not getting it sometimes, and you‚Äôre going to wonder why everyone but you is getting it. Learning to program is fun but frustrating. Don‚Äôt take those frustrations out on others.

### Type out all your code. No copy-and-paste!

When you copy and paste code, even code you fully understand, you miss out on a learning opportunity. Use examples and learn from them, but even if you‚Äôre using a snippet verbatim, **type it out**.

## Using code you didn‚Äôt write

Inevitably you will find code online that makes sense to include in what you‚Äôre writing. Every developer does it. You will find code examples on Stack Overflow, in CSS-Tricks articles, in documentation and blog posts. The nature of this work means that concepts are often best explained with examples.

It is fine to use a line or two of code you read somewhere else *if you understand what it does*. **Never copy and paste code**. If you are using code you found elsewhere, type it out by hand to make sure you understand it and can use it again in a similar situation.

If you want to use a longer snippet of code, it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to do that. If you feel you have good reasons, please attribute the borrowed code in a comment, along with a URL, if possible.

Using AI tools, like ChatGPT, to generate code for you is not allowed.

Above all, don‚Äôt pass off work by someone else as your own. Not only does this violate our Code of Conduct, but it also hinders your learning and will not serve you in becoming a professional developer.

## Developers are problem-solvers, not wizards

Experienced developers become really good at knowing how to find out what they need to know, and where to look for that information. Part of your training here is learning to be a creative, resourceful problem-solver.

One of our goals is to make you as self-sufficient as possible, so we will push you to try to figure things out on your own using as many resources as you can.

Learning to code is hard work. It can sometimes feel like a roller coaster, with successes and failures in quick succession. Coding beginners have moments of elation and moments of despair. This is normal! Just keep working steadily, and know that it takes time for comprehension to develop.

The hard work gets easier when we help each other. It‚Äôs good to ask for help, and it‚Äôs good to offer help. We‚Äôll expect each of you to do both.

## Getting help

Sometimes you‚Äôre stuck. You've tried a bunch of things, you've Googled, and you are out of ideas. When you need help, you have several options.

### Ask colleagues at Momentum

You are encouraged to work together and talk through what you‚Äôre working on. You can ask each other questions, read each other‚Äôs code, and learn from each other.

Ask for help in the team Slack channel, or in #code-help where you are likely to get help from alums.

### Ask an instructor

You can always ask us general questions, following up on what we‚Äôve covered together during meetings, or anything else you‚Äôve encountered and want to know more about.

If you‚Äôve struggled for 30 minutes and haven‚Äôt made any progress, it‚Äôs probably time to talk to an instructor.

When ask a question about code you‚Äôre stuck on, we‚Äôll try to coach you towards a solution rather than giving you the answer. We will want you to talk to us about things like:

- What‚Äôs the precise problem you are seeing or issue that has you stuck?

- What have you already tried? What results did you get?

- What did you learn when you Googled this or asked other folks about it?

### Rubber Ducking üê•

[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is a real technique. When you are stuck on something, sometimes all you need is to talk through the issue out loud. For this, you don‚Äôt even need a real person; you just need a listener. A rubber duck could do it!

In practice we often end up leaning on another person to be a rubber duck for us, and it‚Äôs just a thing we developers do for each other. Know that you will at different times *be* a rubber duck and *need* a rubber duck.

## Social Rules

We‚Äôve borrowed the social rules defined by [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in New York, a community for experienced programmers to learn together. They are not focused on those new to coding, but they are focused on building a supportive learning environment, and we really like their way of thinking.

Below are [the social rules defined by the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules). The text is written by the Recurse Center, because we couldn‚Äôt have said it better, but we‚Äôve adopted the letter and spirit as our own. These rules go into practical detail about respectful collaboration and discourse in a tech context.

### No feigning surprise

The first rule means you shouldn‚Äôt act surprised when people say they don‚Äôt know something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt know what the stack is!") and non-technical things (‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know who RMS is?!‚Äù).

### No well-actually‚Äôs

A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually‚Ä¶" and then give a minor correction. This can be very disruptive when the correction has no bearing on the crux of the conversation

### No back-seat driving

If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn‚Äôt intermittently lob advice across the room. This can lead to the "too many cooks" problem, but more important, it can be rude and disruptive to half-participate in a conversation. This isn‚Äôt to say you shouldn‚Äôt help, offer advice, or join conversations. On the contrary, we encourage all those things. Rather, it just means that when you want to help out or work with others, you should fully engage and not just butt in sporadically.

### No subtle -isms

Our last social rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias. Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake.

For example, saying "It‚Äôs so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it‚Äôs not a big deal to mess up; you just apologize and move on.
