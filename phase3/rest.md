## 🏗️ Project: Design a REST API for the shopping list application

There is no link to generate a repo for this project. You can use a Google doc or a note-taking app or anything you like. You do not have to turn this in. Writing down a detailed plan for the endpoints you plan to build is a first step for actually building an API for your shopping list application.

Your design should include:

- A list of endpoints
- The HTTP methods for each endpoint
- The data that will be sent in the body of POST and PATCH/PUT endpoints
- The data that will be returned from each endpoint
- The status codes that will be returned from each endpoint

Use today's [notes](https://github.com/Momentum-NCCU-Part-Time/notes/blob/main/rest.md) and your front-end shopping list app as a guide.
