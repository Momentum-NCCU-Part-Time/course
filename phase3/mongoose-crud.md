## JS Reps 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️

For today's JS Reps, we will do [Scrabble Score on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/scrabble-score).

The course notes on working with arrays and objects in JavaScript may be helpful.

- [JavaScript Objects](https://github.com/Momentum-NCCU-Part-Time/notes/blob/main/js-objects.md)
- [JavaScript Arrays](https://github.com/Momentum-NCCU-Part-Time/notes/blob/main/js-arrays.md)

## 🏗️ Project: Begin creating the Shopping List API

We'll do this project in stages. This first stage will be to create the API endpoints for the shopping list. We'll use Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB Cloud Atlas database and perform CRUD operations.

- [Shopping List API Project Part One]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.express-shopping-list-api-part-one.url }})

This first part is **due {{ site.data.phase3.projects.express-shopping-list-api-part-one.due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d"}}**.
