## 🎯 Objectives

- Review word frequency project
- Learn about using Express.js to build web applications with Node.js
- Build a tiny web application with Express.js

## 🏗️ Project: Express.js Lorem Ipsum Generator

[*Lorem Ipsum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) is placeholder text that is used in place of written text in design mockups and prototypes. It's useful for testing out layouts and other design elements. In this project, you'll create an Express.js API that generates *Lorem Ipsum* text for a Vue.js application, providing the data formatted as JSON. You _do not_ have to build the Vue.js application.

[Express Lorem Ipsum API project link]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.express-lorem-ipsum.url }})

This project is due {{ site.data.phase3.projects.express-lorem-ipsum.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}.

If you finish this early and want another challenge, there is still the [Node.js Weather project]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.node-weather.url }}) from last week.
