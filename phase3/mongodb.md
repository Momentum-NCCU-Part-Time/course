## JS Reps 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️

For today's JS Reps, we will do [Scrabble Score on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/scrabble-score).

## 🏗️ Project: MongoDB & Mongoose Tutorial

For this project, complete the [MDN Express Tutorial part 3: Mongoose & MongoDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose) to get familiar with using MongoDB and Mongoose with Express.js.

Although this is part 3 of a larger tutorial, you can complete this part without completing the previous parts. You can create a new express project for this tutorial or use any previous express project you have created. However, you can do [the previous step in the tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/skeleton_website), which is a good review of the basics of Express.js.

You do not have to turn this in, but you should use Git You can create your own local git repo with the `git init` command and then add and commit as usual.

Consider pushing your code to GitHub. If you want to do this, you can create a new repo on GitHub and then add it as a remote for your local repo with `git remote add origin <url>`, pasting in the the url from GitHub in place of `<url>`. Once you have configured `origin` this way in your local repo, you can push your code to GitHub with `git push origin main`.

### MongoDB Cloud Atlas ☁️

For our project, we are going to use a cloud-hosted MongoDB database. This is a free service that you can use for your projects. You will need to create an account and a project. You can follow the instructions in MDN tutorial above to do that, or for a video walkthrough, try the [Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas](https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/getting-started-with-mongodb-atlas) tutorial (click on "Get Started").
