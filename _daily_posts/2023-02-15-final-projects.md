The goal of the final project is to give you experience working on a team of developers to ship a software product. You will work in a team of 4 developers to build a web application that addresses a particular need. You will use the skills you have learned in the course to build a full-stack web application, and you will use the tools and processes that you have learned to work together as a team to build and ship the product.

## Teams 🍕 🐢 💥

## ✅ TODO before next Tuesday

1. 🌟 Read [How we use "ship small" to rapidly build new features at GitHub](https://dev.to/mscccc/how-we-use-ship-small-to-rapidly-build-new-features-at-github-5cl9) for an engineer's perspective on an approach to building software that parallels almost precisely the approach we take in Phase 4.
2. 💜 [Are you a Chaos Muppet or an Order Muppet? Read this post and **post your personal findings in Slack 👀**.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/06/chaos-theory.html)
3. **Create a team charter** together and pin or bookmark the document you create in your team's Slack channel. This is an agreement you create together to determine the expectations you have for each other and ensure you can met your goals. Use your experience working on teams in the past to figure out what will help you work together with a **minimum of friction** and a **maximum of productivity**. [Use these steps to create a team charter](https://momentumlearn.notion.site/Create-a-Working-Agreement-bb5c3f432a0a4bc792240543b67b8c9a?pvs=4) and post it in the team channel when you are done.
4. Brainstorm ideas for your final project with your team, and **be ready to pitch your top two ideas next Tuesday**. Use these guidelines to help you brainstorm and pitch your ideas.
