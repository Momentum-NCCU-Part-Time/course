## üéØ Objectives

- What is agile development?
- Git workflow for a team
- Finalize your team charter
- Decide what you are building for your final project
- Real talk about the job search with Luke

## Final Project

Today your goal is to figure out what you are building for your final project with your team. You'll need to [submit a written proposal for your project by the end of class today](https://forms.gle/2qtXxm1spC7cEZkk9).

**One person** on your team should accept the project invitation and create a new team, using your team name. Then the other devs should follow the project link and choose their team.

[Team Project Repo]({{ site.data.phase4.projects.final-project.url }})

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE! You have to use the link above to join the team your teammate created in order to have write permissions to the repo.

**Today you will not commit or push any code since your main goal is planning**.

## How to work as one team

You're working together to ship a product, on time. Dividing up the work requires planning out what you need to build ahead of time. You can make product decisions together even though you will implement features separately, and every developer bears a responsibility for the success of the project.

Communicating well with your teammates is a critical part of this project. You will need to communicate with each other frequently so that you aren't duplicating work or building things that won't work together, and meet as often as possible given everyone's schedules. Pairing or working together in groups is encouraged.

**You also are encouraged to work with the other team to share ideas, advice, approaches, and resources.**

Working with other developers in a shared codebase also means that the way you have been using Git and GitHub so far will have to change. This is definitely going to slow you down at first, but it's part of what you are learning in this project.

## Planning User Flow

You will need to sketch out the **[user flow](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)** and [draw up some **wireframes**](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-design-101/) for the application. It can help to ask questions like:

- What does our user see when they first land on our site?
- What will they need to do here?
- How will they accomplish that?
- What will happen next?
- If they click on a button or link, what happens?
- What does the UI look like after the user clicks on something / follows a link / submits a form?

**Every developer on the team should be able to answer these questions.** In other words, everyone has to be on the same page and how the app works is everyone's responsibility.
